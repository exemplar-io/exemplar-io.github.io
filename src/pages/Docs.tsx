      <p className="text-m">
        For a developer, setting up a new project from scratch can be a diï¬€icult
        task. The developer has to come up with a good overall design and
        architecture, while also choosing which tech stacks to use. By picking
        the correct choices from the beginning, a lot of time spent refactoring
        code in the future can be mitigated and the focus of the developer can
        be on developing cool features instead!
      </p>
      <p className="text-m">
        Pear is a framework with the intention to help developers build full
        stack software solutions, by providing an out-of-the-box template to
        generate a project, with a frontend, backend consisting of
        microservices, message queue and a DevOps setup with pipelines for
        automatic testing and deployment. The motivation behind this is to
        ensure a software project doesn't run in to scalability issues, security
        issues and in general help the project evolving in a direction that
        satisfy both short-term, but especially long-term requirements. From the
        rest of the documentation page, we will use the name Orange to specify,
        that we are talking about the generated project.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl">How does it work?</h2>
      <p className="text-m">
        Imagine you, a developer, wants to start a new project. What would be
        the first steps you take? Probably picking an adequate frontend and
        backend technology and create a Git repository to utilise version
        control. By looking at the diagram, the idea behind Pear is, that you
        are asked to authorise your Github account and choose a project name and
        a project is generated for you, with a frontend application, a message
        queue and two microservices.

      />
      <h2 className="text-2xl">Tech stack</h2>
      <p className="text-m">
        In this section the generated tech stack will briefly be mentioned, and
        later on a more in-depth walk-through of Orange will be introduced.
        {<span className="font-bold"> All</span>} of the following applications
        are dockerized
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc">
        <li>The frontend application is a React application with Typescript</li>
        <li>The microservices are Nestjs applications with Typescript</li>
        <li>A RabbitMQ which is already setup and both microservices use</li>
        <li>
          Git modules with the frontend application and two microservice
          applications in a root repository
        </li>
        <li>
          Docker-compose that spins up the whole system, so development can
          start immediately
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1 className="text-4xl">What's generated</h1>
      <p className="text-secondary text-m text-left">
        So what exactly happens after you click the button "Generate project"?
        In this section we'll cover the the different components that we
        generate for you.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl">Root repository</h2>
      <p className="text-m">
        When we are done generating the code for you, you will be presented with
        a link to the root repository. This will look similar to the screenshot
        seen below. The root project will be a stand alone Github repository
        which contains references to all the repositories we have generated. The
        different references are so called{' '}
        <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">
          submodules
        </a>
        . Which are basically just links to other stand alone repositories - but
        it allows you to clone (download) the entire project in one go!
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from the submodule references, the root project also contains a
        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/"> docker-compose</a> file.
        With this file, after you've downloaded the project, you can spin up the
        entire thing with the command docker-compose up. To allow for this, we
        have wrapped each component of the project in a container with a
        Dockerfile. But more about this in the "Workflow" section.
      </p>
      <img
        src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/docs/root.png'}
        alt="overview"
        className="w-3/4 m-auto"
      />
      <h2 className="text-2xl">Frontend repository</h2>
      <p className="text-m">
        So, the most flashy part of your newly generated project is definitely
        the frontend. This repository has the code for an entire web application
        developed in <a href="https://reactjs.org/">ReactJS</a>! We have chosen
        to use <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a> as the
        development language for the web application, but you can also develop
        ReactJS web apps in Javascript.
      </p>
      <p className="text-m">
        Just like all the other repositories we generate for you, we have
        wrapped the frontend in a docker container. The configurations for the
        docker container can be found in the Dockerfile - it allows you to run
        the frontend in pretty much any environment, abstracting away the OS
        details of the specific environment you're in.
      </p>
      <p className="text-m">
        From the get go, the frontend contains a simple login component, that
        allows the user to authenticate themselves with a username and a
        password. When you log in, the web application actually communicates
        with the backend which is divided into two repositories. The Api
        repository and the MS repository.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl">Api repository</h2>
      <p className="text-m">
        The Api repository is the gateway into your backend. It's a standalone
        <a href="https://nestjs.com/" target="_blank">
          {' '}
          nestJS project
        </a>{' '}
        written in Typescript, which serves the API to the outside world - and
        in this case it serves the frontend web application we generated for
        you. In this project you write the different endpoints you want to have
        for your backend. To allow the user to login we have already created a
        /login endpoint, which expects a username and a password as input. These
        details will be forwarded to the relevant microservice through a
        RabbitMQ message queue. In the case of the login endpoint the relevant
        microservice is the user microservice, which has its own standalone
        repository - the user-ms repository which is up next!
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl">User ms repository</h2>
      <p className="text-m">
        The user-ms repository is the microservice dedicated to handling
        everything regarding the users of your application. Just like the Api
        repository, this is a NestJS project written in Typescript. Instead of
        hosting Rest endpoint, it listens to the RabbitMQ message queue for
        messages. From the get go we have set it up to listen for a login
        message, with login credentials. When a login message is received it
        checks an in-memory database with users, to see if the credentials
        match. If the credentials match, a Json Web Token is generated and sent
        back through the RabbitMQ message queue. Using JWTs for authentication
        is a very popular and highly scalable method of implementing
        authentication - you can read a lot more about it on the official
        <a href="https://jwt.io/" target="_blank">
          {' '}
          website for JWT
        </a>
        .
