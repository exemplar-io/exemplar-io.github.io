      <p className="text-m">
        For a developer, setting up a new project from scratch can be a diï¬€icult
        task. The developer has to come up with a good overall design and
        architecture, while also choosing which tech stacks to use. By picking
        the correct choices from the beginning, a lot of time spent refactoring
        code in the future can be mitigated and the focus of the developer can
        be on developing cool features instead!

        Pear is a framework with the intention to help developers build full
        stack software solutions, by providing an out-of-the-box template to
        generate a project, with a frontend, backend consisting of
        microservices, message queue and a DevOps setup with pipelines for
        automatic testing and deployment. The motivation behind this is to
        ensure a software project doesn't run in to scalability issues, security
        issues and in general help the project evolving in a direction that
        satisfy both short-term, but especially long-term requirements. From the
        rest of the documentation page, we will use the name Orange to specify,
        that we are talking about the generated project.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl">How does it work?</h2>
      <p className="text-m">
        Imagine you, a developer, wants to start a new project. What would be
        the first steps you take? Probably picking an adequate frontend and
        backend technology and create a Git repository to utilise version
        control. By looking at the diagram, the idea behind Pear is, that you
        are asked to authorise your Github account and choose a project name and
        a project is generated for you, with a frontend application, a message
        queue and two microservices.

        In this section the generated tech stack will briefly be mentioned, and
        later on a more in-depth walk-through of Orange will be introduced.

        <li>The frontend application is a React application with Typescript</li>
        <li>The microservices are Nestjs applications with Typescript</li>
        <li>A RabbitMQ which is already setup and both microservices use</li>
        <li>
          Git modules with the frontend application and two microservice
          applications in a root repository
